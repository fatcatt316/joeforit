Welp, everyone's favorite year has ended, and it's on to 2021.

I've neglected working on this book for a bit, but some random serendipity has kickstarted things back in motion.

About a week ago, I talked with a class at the local coding bootcamp <a href="https://www.momentumlearn.com/">Momentum</a> and realized (again) how much a book like this could help people just starting out in software development.

Also, a few really helpful people have been helping proofread and edit the book recently, so I've been inspired to keep all this momentum going.

Getting the book 80% done was a piece o' cake, compared to finishing this last 20%.

2021 is the year this book will be released to the world, or my name's not Joseph M. Peck, Esq!
