Heck yeah, we're moving ever closer to the actual release of this book!
ðŸ™Œ

Since I finished [getting the book into Leanpub and fixing the formatting]({% post_url 2021-04-25-leanpub-mission-accomplished %}), I've been busy with some other book-related things, in the few hours I can squeeze out between work and family.

I've updated the contact info of all the software people who appear in the book (over 50 of them!), and snazzed up [the landing page for the book](https://leanpub.com/datadump/) (**head on over to that page if you want to be notified once it's published!**).

Besides all that, I've decided to bite the bullet and actually pay for some help with the book cover, instead of YOLOing my way to a homemade book cover design. A helpful reader of [my previous post]({% post_url 2021-04-25-leanpub-mission-accomplished %}) alerted me to a designer they know, and I've been working with him to come up with a book cover that'll wow the publishing world, and no doubt lead to this book hitting the best seller list within weeks, if not days!

Once the book cover design's complete, I should be all ready to pull the trigger, and release this handy software book out into the worldðŸ¤ž

So keep your eye out for that! That's all for now...
