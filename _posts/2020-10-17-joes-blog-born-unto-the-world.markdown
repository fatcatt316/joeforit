After a year or so of YOLOing it with this website, and not using any framework, I've taken the plunge and am gonna give [Jekyll][jekyll-home] a shot.

I wanted to add a web log (or "blog" as some of the young bloods have taken to calling it), and didn't want to be copying and pasting template/navigation changes across a bunch of files.

Turns out Jekyll's pretty jawsome! There's a little learning curve, and I don't quite have this site looking like I want it to (next step: get pop-up ads up and running!), but dangit, it's good enough for now.

I plan on using this to post some updates about the [software book I'm writing][book-news], plus other idears that pop into my noggin.

I hope you enjoy your stay at PeckYeah; por favor stay as long as you like ðŸ™‡
