"Hold up," I hear you say, "What book are you talking about?"

Welp, I've been working on a book about software development for over a year now. I interviewed more than 50 software professionals, and squeezed (squoze?) helpful real-life lessons out of them.

My goal is for the book to help people who are just now starting out in software, as well as reigniting the fire for grizzled, world-weary coding veterans.

This book is taking so dang long _mainly_ because it's been tough to squeeze out some dedicated time to sit down and work on it, what with two lil' kids and a full-time job.

But, whining aside, the book is nearing the finish line! I have a bunch of small updates to make regarding the interviewees, and also some polishing up to do, but I'd estimate it's 90% done!

If you want to follow along as I bumble through writing and publishing my first book, por favor take a few seconds to [sign up for the newsletter][book-news] to stay updated on its progress. I promise not to sell your email info, unless someone offers me money, in which case all bets are off.
