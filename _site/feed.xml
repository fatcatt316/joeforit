&lt;p&gt;Welp, I‚Äôve been working on a book about software development for over a year now. I interviewed more than 50 software professionals, and squeezed (squoze?) helpful real-life lessons out of them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My goal is for the book to help people who are just now starting out in software, as well as reigniting the fire for grizzled, world-weary coding veterans.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This book is taking so dang long &lt;em&gt;mainly&lt;/em&gt; because it‚Äôs been tough to squeeze out some dedicated time to sit down and work on it, what with two lil‚Äô kids and a full-time job.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But, whining aside, the book is nearing the finish line! I have a bunch of small updates to make regarding the interviewees, and also some polishing up to do, but I‚Äôd estimate it‚Äôs 90% done!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you want to follow along as I bumble through writing and publishing my first book, por favor take a few seconds to &lt;a href=&quot;https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSdSHAza-dYgLOqR20o_hwcTtbd1o4d2d5-0wM8Ssadpnh7hBQ/viewform&quot;&gt;sign up for the newsletter&lt;/a&gt; to stay updated on its progress. I promise not to sell your email info, unless someone offers me money, in which case all bets are off.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name></name></author><category term="book" /><summary type="html">‚ÄúHold up,‚Äù I hear you say, ‚ÄúWhat book are you talking about?‚Äù</summary></entry><entry><title type="html">Lo, a Blog is Born Unto the World</title><link href="http://localhost:4000/blog/joes-blog-born-unto-the-world" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="Lo, a Blog is Born Unto the World" /><published>2020-10-17T14:55:50-04:00</published><updated>2020-10-17T14:55:50-04:00</updated><id>http://localhost:4000/blog/joes-blog-born-unto-the-world</id><content type="html" xml:base="http://localhost:4000/blog/joes-blog-born-unto-the-world">&lt;p&gt;After a year or so of YOLOing it with this website, and not using any framework, I‚Äôve taken the plunge and am giving &lt;a href=&quot;https://jekyllrb.com&quot;&gt;Jekyll&lt;/a&gt; a shot.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I wanted to add a web log (or ‚Äúblog‚Äù as some of the young bloods have taken to calling it), and didn‚Äôt want to be copying and pasting template/navigation changes across a bunch of files.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Turns out Jekyll‚Äôs pretty jawsome! There‚Äôs a little learning curve, and I don‚Äôt quite have this site looking like I want it to (next step: get pop-up ads up and running), but dangit, it‚Äôs good enough for now.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I plan on using this to post updates about the &lt;a href=&quot;https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSdSHAza-dYgLOqR20o_hwcTtbd1o4d2d5-0wM8Ssadpnh7hBQ/viewform&quot;&gt;software book I‚Äôm writing&lt;/a&gt;, plus other idears that pop into my noggin.&lt;/p&gt;
