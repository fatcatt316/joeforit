Peck.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Most of them either didn‚Äôt reply or replied with a quick ‚ÄúNo thanks‚Äù, although I ended up working with a couple of them for a few months before things fizzled out (e.g., ‚ÄúIt doesn‚Äôt fit with the direction we‚Äôre taking‚Äù).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My thoughts began to turn to &lt;strong&gt;self-publishing&lt;/strong&gt; as a way to get the book out to the yearning public‚Ä¶&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/images/look-at-me.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Look at me. I am the publisher now.&quot; title=&quot;Look at me. I am the publisher now.&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Anyhoo, a few people sent me &lt;a href=&quot;https://threadreaderapp.com/thread/1282199525562753025.html&quot;&gt;this Twitter thread&lt;/a&gt; by Vlad Mihalcea (&lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/vlad_mihalcea&quot;&gt;@vlad_mihalcea&lt;/a&gt;) where he detailed how he wrote and published his technical book. After checking it out a bit more, I decided to give &lt;a href=&quot;https://leanpub.com/&quot;&gt;ol‚Äô Leanpub&lt;/a&gt; a shot yesterday.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I was crestfallen to learn that they &lt;a href=&quot;http://help.leanpub.com/en/articles/4995616-what-happened-to-leanpub-s-google-docs-writing-mode&quot;&gt;recently got rid of their Google Docs writing mode&lt;/a&gt;, since that‚Äôs what my whole book is written in. But, in the true American spirit, I hoisted up my bootstraps and began figuring out how to get my book from Google Docs into Leanpub.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I found this &lt;a href=&quot;https://workspace.google.com/marketplace/app/docs_to_markdown/700168918607&quot;&gt;handy Docs to Markdown extension&lt;/a&gt;, and started using it. It mostly seems to work, but once I get the files into Leanpub, the real ‚Äúfun‚Äù begins.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Some crazy formatting happens; smart quotes get turned into wacky characters, question marks get weird, and oh lawd the footnotes. It‚Äôs taking more time than I‚Äôd hoped to get the footnotes working (for example, it keeps adding two footnotes to a spot where I‚Äôm only specifying one in the markdown).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That being said, I‚Äôm not about to give up on Leanpub yet. Parts of it seem to work really well (although I‚Äôm not able to scroll with a mouse in writing mode), and I think once I figure out the footnotes it‚Äôll be smooth sailing ü§û&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you have experience with Leanpub, or another publisher, por favor let me know!&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name></name></author><summary type="html">Last year, I researched a ton of different publishing options, and reached out to a dozen or so publishers through my literary agent, Professor Joseph M.

&lt;p&gt;I‚Äôve mentioned &lt;a href=&quot;/blog/so-whats-up-with-the-book&quot;&gt;a time&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=&quot;/blog/new-year-new-momentum&quot;&gt;two&lt;/a&gt; on this site that I‚Äôm writing a book aimed at people just now jumping into software development, but I haven‚Äôt shared any of the book outside of some editors‚Ä¶ until now.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I figure there‚Äôs a few benefits to sharing parts of a book before it‚Äôs done. For one, maybe it‚Äôll get a person or two pumped up about reading the book once it‚Äôs completed. Two, it‚Äôll help motivate me to finish this book if I feel like more people are waiting on it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A big piece of my book is made up of interviews with experienced software people. To give a feel for the wide variety of viewpoints readers can expect to see in my book, I wrote the section below, which will be near the beginning of the book.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Let me know your thoughts on it! And if you decide you‚Äôd like to follow along as this book progresses, either &lt;a href=&quot;https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSdSHAza-dYgLOqR20o_hwcTtbd1o4d2d5-0wM8Ssadpnh7hBQ/viewform&quot;&gt;leave your email here&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=&quot;/feed.xml&quot;&gt;follow the RSS feed&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;h1 style=&quot;margin-top: 15px&quot;&gt;Diversity of Perspectives&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Although many of the excellent software professionals who appear here crossed paths with me in a small geographic area (North Carolina‚Äôs Research Triangle), they have wildly different backgrounds and experiences, providing a diverse set of viewpoints in their answers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Many of the software experts in this book don‚Äôt have ‚Äútraditional‚Äù computer science backgrounds. Some dropped out of college or graduated with a degree unrelated to programming. Many of them have worked in completely different fields, including a science museum docent, cicerone (like a sommelier, but for beer!), farmer, chef, and high school teacher, before making the move into software.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These people have lived all over the world ‚Äì India, Vietnam, Singapore ‚Äì and across the USA, from Portland on down to Miami. They‚Äôre fluent in a slew of programming languages, including JavaScript, Go, Ruby, Python, and Elixir, as well as many real-world languages, such as Hindi, Chinese, Spanish, Russian, Bosnian, and German, to name a few. They‚Äôve worked many different jobs at a wide variety of companies. Several have founded their own successful startups, while others have worked at international mega-corporations like Google and Cisco.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Some of them have even written tech books of their own! And a few others are core contributors to very popular code libraries (Babel and Terraform, to name two) that are used daily by tens of thousands of software developers around the world.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Thanks to this depth and diversity, this book is able to provide many different viewpoints and advice from these software professionals. I know I learned a ton from reading the respondents‚Äô survey responses, and I bet you will, too; this book is chock-full of lessons about how to succeed in the software biz and to better understand just what it‚Äôs like to work in this field.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With such a wide, fantastic pool of software development knowledge at my beck and call, I had to come up with some dang good questions to ask in hope of drawing out all that sweet, hard-won programming wisdom. To set the scene, and also so you know the questions I sent these experts (and why), I‚Äôll go over them here and answer each one myself. After that, we‚Äôll move on to the meat and potatoes of this book: the illuminating responses from the esteemed programming professionals.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name></name></author><summary type="html"></summary></entry><entry><title type="html">New Year, New Momentum</title><link href="http://localhost:4000/blog/new-year-new-momentum" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="New Year, New Momentum" /><published>2021-01-30T15:10:38-05:00</published><updated>2021-01-30T15:10:38-05:00</updated><id>http://localhost:4000/blog/new-year-new-momentum</id><content type="html" xml:base="http://localhost:4000/blog/new-year-new-momentum">&lt;p&gt;Welp, everyone‚Äôs favorite year has ended, and it‚Äôs on to 2021.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I‚Äôve neglected working on this book for a bit, but some random serendipity has kickstarted things back in motion.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;About a week ago, I talked with a class at the local coding bootcamp &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.momentumlearn.com/&quot;&gt;Momentum&lt;/a&gt; and realized (again) how much a book like this could help people just starting out in software development.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Also, a few really helpful people have been helping proofread and edit the book recently, so I‚Äôve been inspired to keep all this momentum going.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Getting the book 80% done was a piece o‚Äô cake, compared to finishing this last 20%.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;2021 is the year this book will be released to the world, or my name‚Äôs not Joseph M. Peck, Esq!&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name></name></author><summary type="html">Welp, everyone‚Äôs favorite year has ended, and it‚Äôs on to 2021.</summary></entry><entry><title type="html">So What‚Äôs Up With The Book?</title><link href="http://localhost:4000/blog/so-whats-up-with-the-book" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="So What‚Äôs Up With The Book?" /><published>2020-10-17T15:36:05-04:00</published><updated>2020-10-17T15:36:05-04:00</updated><id>http://localhost:4000/blog/so-whats-up-with-the-book</id><content type="html" xml:base="http://localhost:4000/blog/so-whats-up-with-the-book">&lt;p&gt;‚ÄúHold up,‚Äù I hear you say, ‚ÄúWhat book are you talking about?‚Äù&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Welp, I‚Äôve been working on a book about software development for over a year now. I interviewed more than 50 software professionals, and squeezed (squoze?) helpful real-life lessons out of them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My goal is for the book to help people who are just now starting out in software, as well as reigniting the fire for grizzled, world-weary coding veterans.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This book is taking so dang long &lt;em&gt;mainly&lt;/em&gt; because it‚Äôs been tough to squeeze out some dedicated time to sit down and work on it, what with two lil‚Äô kids and a full-time job.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But, whining aside, the book is nearing the finish line! I have a bunch of small updates to make regarding the interviewees, and also some polishing up to do, but I‚Äôd estimate it‚Äôs 90% done!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you want to follow along as I bumble through writing and publishing my first book, por favor take a few seconds to &lt;a href=&quot;https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSdSHAza-dYgLOqR20o_hwcTtbd1o4d2d5-0wM8Ssadpnh7hBQ/viewform&quot;&gt;sign up for the newsletter&lt;/a&gt; to stay updated on its progress.

&lt;p&gt;I wanted to add a web log (or ‚Äúblog‚Äù as some of the young bloods have taken to calling it), and didn‚Äôt want to be copying and pasting template/navigation changes across a bunch of files.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Turns out Jekyll‚Äôs pretty jawsome! There‚Äôs a little learning curve, and I don‚Äôt quite have this site looking like I want it to (next step: get pop-up ads up and running), but dangit, it‚Äôs good enough for now.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I plan on using this to post updates about the &lt;a href=&quot;https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSdSHAza-dYgLOqR20o_hwcTtbd1o4d2d5-0wM8Ssadpnh7hBQ/viewform&quot;&gt;software book I‚Äôm writing&lt;/a&gt;, plus other idears that pop into my noggin.&lt;/p&gt;
