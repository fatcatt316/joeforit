<h1>Howdy! I'm Joe 👋</h1>

<p>
  I've been developing software professionally for about 15 years, mainly with Ruby, Python, and Elixir. I'm big on code maintainability, teamwork, and intuitive UX.
</p>

<p>
  When I'm not working away at software development, I like to wrassle around with my kids, play sports (🏀🏈⚽🥏🏓), travel, read, garden, and cook (and eat!).
</p>

<p>I'm also in the midst of writing a <a href="https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSdSHAza-dYgLOqR20o_hwcTtbd1o4d2d5-0wM8Ssadpnh7hBQ/viewform">book about software development</a>. One thing I've learned is that it takes a long time to finish writing a book!</p>
<p>
  Feel free to send me an email at <script language="JavaScript">
              var name1 = 'e';
              var name2 = 'jo';
              var yay = 'peckyeah.com';
              document.write('<i class="fas fa-paper-plane"></i>')
              document.write('<a href=\"mailto:' + name2 + name1 + '@' + yay + '\">');
              document.write(name2 + name1 + '@' + yay + '</a>');
            </script>.
</p>
<p>
  🙇
